<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a young mother of three kids, two are mine and one step child. I am happily engaged to my beloved partner.
  I have a love for animals. I am trying to better myself and enter a new career that will allow me to be at home with my kids and bring
  in some income to our household. I am a very independent woman and do not want my partner to feel like they are doing it all on their own.
  My children are my pride and joy, I'm not sure I could live without them.
